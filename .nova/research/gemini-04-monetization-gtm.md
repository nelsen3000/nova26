# Gemini-04: Monetization & Go-to-Market Strategy
## Source: Gemini Deep Research Round 04 (Feb 19, 2026)
## Status: Accepted

## Pricing Recommendation: "Sovereign Tier" Model

| Tier | Price | Included | Gate |
|------|-------|----------|------|
| Indie (Local-First) | $12/mo | Unlimited local agents, Taste Vault, 1-project Convex | Projects & cloud depth |
| Pro (Hybrid) | $25/mo | Pro models (GPT-5/Claude 4), unlimited Convex, Graph Memory | Team features & security |
| Team (Agent Seats) | $45/seat/mo | "Agent Squads", central wisdom repo, team analytics | SSO, audit logs, SLA |

## Local-First Advantage
Charge for the system & sync, not the tokens. Users save $30-150/mo on API fees.

## PLG Viral Loops

2. Viral Challenge Badges — "Mars Milestone" (100 backend mutations) on GitHub profiles
3. Two-sided referrals — Pro-Model Credits for referrer + referred

## Launch Strategy (Primed Pipeline)
- Stealth: 400+ core community (Discord, X, LinkedIn)
- Open Beta (-4 weeks): 1,000+ emails via "Aha Moment" demos
- Launch Week: Product Hunt + HN + Dev.to (staggered waves)
- Post-Launch (+30 days): expansion to teams via weekly "Velocity" reports

## Revenue Projections to $1M ARR
- Scenario A: ~7,000 Indie users @ $12/mo
- Scenario B: ~3,300 Pro users @ $25/mo
- Scenario C: 100 teams (10 seats) @ $45/mo + 1,500 Indie users

## Marketplace
- 70/30 revenue share for user-created Agent Skills
- Agent Template Gallery (e.g., "Fintech Security Squad")

## Competitive Positioning
Position as "Sovereign Multi-Agent Architecture" — 21 specialized experts vs one generic chatbot, with zero marginal cost (Ollama).
