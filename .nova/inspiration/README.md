# Inspiration Folder

Drop screenshots, mockups, user flows, and visual references here. Organized by type:

| Folder | What Goes Here |
|--------|---------------|
| `screenshots/` | Screenshots of UIs you like (apps, websites, dashboards) |
| `ui-flows/` | User flow diagrams, wireframes, journey maps |
| `ux-patterns/` | Specific UX patterns to replicate (modals, onboarding, etc.) |
| `color-palettes/` | Color schemes, gradient references, theme inspiration |
| `competitor-references/` | Screenshots/notes from competing products |
| `component-ideas/` | Specific component designs to build toward |
| `animations/` | Animation references (GIFs, videos, Lottie files) |
| `typography/` | Font pairings, type scale references |

All AI agents (Kimi, Claude, Kiro, MiniMax) can reference these files when building UI.
